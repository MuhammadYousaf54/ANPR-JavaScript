ANPR Project:-

This project implements Automatic Number Plate 
Recognition (ANPR) using Node.js for
backend integration, Tesseract.js 
for OCR (Optical Character Recognition). 
It processes images, detects license plates,
and saves the recognized text to a 
MongoDB database

Project Overview:-

The ANPR project captures images of 
vehicles, extracts the number plates
using image processing and OCR, and
stores the recognized plate numbers in 
a MongoDB database. 
This solution is ideal for applications 
such as parking management, traffic
monitoring, and toll collection systems.

Features:-

Image Preprocessing: Converts the image
to grayscale and applies filters for
better OCR accuracy.

OCR using Tesseract.js: Recognizes the 
text from vehicle number plates.

MongoDB Integration: Saves the recognized
number plates and other related data to 
a database.

REST API: Provides endpoints for 
managing the processed data.
